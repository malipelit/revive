# Assignment: Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction and Classification

## Objective

To gain experience on the use of classification.

## Datasets

Since the datasets are very large, they won't be found in the repo.

### Dataset A
This data is the splice junctions on DNA sequences. The given data set includes 2200 samples with 57 features, in the matrix ’fea’. It is a binary class problem. The class labels are either +1 or -1, given in the vector ’gnd’. Parameter selection and classification tasks are conducted on this data set. (File: DataA.csv) 

### Dataset B
This data consists of 3 different types of irises’ (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) petal and sepal length. The rows being the samples and the columns being: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width. (File: DataB.csv)

### Dataset C
Handwritten digits of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 (5 classes). This dataset contains 2066 samples with 784 features corresponding to a 28 x 28 gray-scale (0-255) image of the digit, arranged in column-wise. This data is used to illustrate the difference between feature extraction methods. (File: DataC.csv)

## Tasks

### 1. Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction
    - Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)
    - ISOMAP
    - Naive Bayes Classifier
    - PCA and LDA

### 2. Binary Classification
    - k Nearest Neighbor (k-NN)
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM) with rbf kernel
    - Naive Bayes Classifier
    - Decision Tree
    - Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score)

### 3. Multi-Class Classification
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear kernel
    - the “one-versus-all” and “one-versus-one” strategy
    - Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score)
    - Confusion Matrix
    - Decision Tree

# Assignment: Neural Networks and Fuzzy Inference Systems

## Objective

To gain experience on the use of Neural Networks and Fuzzy Inference Systems

## Tasks

### 1. Neural Network
    - Feedforward Back-propagtaion Neural Network
    - Logistic activation function
    - Training and testing error
    - Optimal number of hidden nodes

Use a neural network with one hidden layer to study how training size and number of hidden nodes affect errors. Generate data, run experiments varying these factors, and analyze the results with error plots.

### 2. MLP Network
    - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
    - Training and testing error
    - Optimal number of hidden neurons

Train an MLP on 500 data points with varying hidden neurons to find the best number for lowest error.

## Results

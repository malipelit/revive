# Assignment: Data Cleaning and Dimensionality Reduction

## Objective

To study how to apply some of the methods discussed in class like Data Cleaning and Dimensionality Reduction on two datasets.

## Data Sets

### Dataset A
This is a time-series dataset which is collected from a set of motion sensors for wearable activity recognition. The data is given in time order, with 19000 samples and 81 features. Some missing values are denoted by Not Available (NA) and also some outliers are present. (File: DataA.csv)

### Dataset B
Handwritten digits of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 (5 classes). This dataset contains 2066 samples with 784 features corresponding to a 28 x 28 gray-scale (0-255) image of the digit, arranged in column-wise. (File: DataB.csv) 

## Tasks

### 1. Data cleaning and preprocessing 
    - Outliers, missing values
    - Min-max normalization
    - Z-score normalization

### 2. Feature Extraction
    - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    - Naive Bayes Classifier
    - Linear Discriminany Analysis (LDA)

## Results

The results can be viewed on the report which is named as `Report.pdf`

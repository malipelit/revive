# Revive

In this repo, I will redo my old school projects and assignments. My aim is to remember what I have done in the past and also keep a meemory of them in GitHub.

## Projects and Assignments

- Machine Learning Assignments
- New ML Projects
- Software Projects and Assignments
- Home Security System (Capstone Project)

## Machine Learning Assignments

In this part, I will go over assignments in my ML courses. There are bunch of different valuable algorithms which I can't wait to remember:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Linear Regression
- k Nearest Neighbor
- Decision Trees (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- SVM
- PCA, LDA
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Deep Learning (CNN, Word2Vec, Next Word Prediction, Generating New Faces, MLP)
- K-Means
- Autoencoders
- Fuzzy Interference Systems
- Reinforcement Learning (SARSA, Expected SARSA, Q Learning, Double Q Learning)
